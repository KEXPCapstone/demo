As one of the world’s most influential listener-supported radio stations, 90.3 KEXP-FM Seattle gives on-air hosts the freedom to provide excellent curated programming for a global community. KEXP’s library of over 70,000 albums is an essential programming resource and historical archive of the station’s sonic identity.

‘Shelves’ amplifies DJs’ ability to craft creative broadcasts by augmenting the physical music library with tools for searching, organizing, and music discovery.

Up against a musical landscape dominated by algorithmic suggestion, ‘Shelves’ aides KEXP in its mission to preserve “robot-free radio” and place human curation back at the heart of the listener experience.
