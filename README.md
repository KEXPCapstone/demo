# Abstract

As one of the world’s most influential listener-supported radio stations, 90.3 KEXP-FM Seattle gives on-air hosts the freedom to provide excellent curated programming for a global community.

Housed in a purpose-built room at the station’s home in Seattle Center, KEXP’s library of over 70,000 vinyl and CD albums is an essential programming resource and historical archive of the station’s sonic identity.

‘Shelves’ amplifies DJs’ ability to craft creative broadcasts by augmenting the physical music library with tools for searching, organizing, and discovering music in the collection.

In response to a musical landscape dominated by algorithmic suggestion, ‘Shelves’ uses technology to aid KEXP in its mission to preserve “robot-free radio” and place human curation and connection back at the heart of the listener experience.
