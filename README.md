# Abstract

Shelves transforms KEXP's library of 70,000 vinyl and CD albums into a digital curation tool that preserves the sonic identity of the world's premier listener-supported radio station.

Shelves amplifies radio hosts’ ability to craft creative broadcasts by augmenting the physical music library with tools for searching, organizing, and discovering music in the collection.

 In response to a musical landscape dominated by algorithmic suggestion, Shelves uses technology to aid KEXP in its mission to preserve “robot-free radio” and place human curation and connection back at the heart of the listener experience.
